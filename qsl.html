						<h1>Variational Method applied on a Quantum Spin Liquid</h1>
					</header>
					<span class="image right onload-image-fade-in"><img src="Website-Photos/Kagome.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>In embarking on this project, I undertook the implementation of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver
						(VQE) simulation with a specific focus on estimating the ground state for antiferromagnetic spin
						liquids situated within a Kagome lattice. The Kagome lattice, known for its unique geometric
						arrangement, posed a challenging yet intriguing backdrop for exploring the quantum dynamics of
						antiferromagnetic spin systems. Leveraging the principles of VQE, a quantum algorithm tailored
						for near-term quantum computers, my objective was to push the boundaries of simulation accuracy.
						Through meticulous calibration and optimization, I achieved remarkable precision, confining the
						estimated ground state within a 5 percent error margin relative to the actual ground state of
						the system.
					</p>
					<p>In the course of this project, I delved deep into the nuances of quantum algorithms and their
						application in the realm of condensed matter physics. The intricate interplay of spins in
						antiferromagnetic systems within the Kagome lattice demanded a nuanced approach to quantum
						simulation. I navigated the complexities of encoding the problem onto a quantum computer,
						defining a suitable ansatz describing the neighboring behaviors of the electrons., and
						fine-tuning the classical optimizer to achieve the desired accuracy. The iterative nature of the
						VQE algorithm allowed for a dynamic exploration of the solution space, enabling me to converge
						towards the ground state while maintaining a tight control on the permissible error.
					</p>
					<p>The significance of this work extends beyond the immediate scope of quantum simulations, touching
						upon broader themes in quantum computing and condensed matter physics. Successfully constraining
						the error to a 5 percent margin not only validates the efficacy of the VQE approach but also
						opens avenues for further exploration in understanding the quantum behavior of antiferromagnetic
						spin liquids. This project, rooted in the cutting edge of quantum computing, contributes to the
						ongoing dialogue on the practical utility of quantum algorithms in unraveling the mysteries of
						complex many-body quantum systems.
