					<p>
						During my time working on the Centripetal Electronic Robotic Navigator (CERN) project, I focused
						on enhancing the software that governs the functionality of this Sphero-like robot. A major
						aspect of my responsibilities involved refining the Bluetooth encoding to ensure seamless
						communication between the robot and external devices. This optimization not only improved data
						transfer rates but also enhanced the overall reliability of the robot's connectivity.
						Additionally, I delved into the intricacies of power management strategies, implementing
						efficient protocols to maximize the robot's operational lifespan while maintaining optimal
						performance.</p>
					<p>One of the key challenges I addressed was the reduction of latency in the robot's responsiveness.
						This required a careful examination of the software architecture, identifying bottlenecks, and
						implementing solutions to streamline processes. By fine-tuning the closed-loop controller, I
						aimed to achieve precise and efficient control, enabling the robot to navigate seamlessly in
						various environments. This involved creating a special closed control loop algorithm designed to
						approximate functions that adapt to the changing frame of reference and center of mass,
						contributing significantly to the robot's improved direction maintenance.
					</p>
					<p>A substantial portion of my efforts was dedicated to establishing robust serial communication
						protocols. This not only ensured the integrity of data exchange between the robot and its
						control systems but also laid the foundation for future scalability and compatibility with
						additional features. The implementation of these enhancements collectively contributed to a more
						sophisticated and capable Centripetal Electronic Robotic Navigator, setting the stage for its
						successful integration into diverse applications and environments.</p>
					<p>In addition to the technical aspects, my role demanded a holistic approach to problem-solving.
						Collaborating with the team, I sought to create a cohesive system that seamlessly integrated the
						refined software enhancements. This involved constant communication and coordination to align
						the software improvements with the mechanical components of the CERN robot. The project not only
						honed my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into the interdisciplinary nature
						of robotics, where software intricacies and mechanical precision converge to create a truly
						innovative and functional robotic system.</p>
