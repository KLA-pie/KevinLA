						<h1>Volatile Migration of Water on Mercury</h1>
					</header>
					<span class="image right onload-image-fade-in"><img src="Website-Photos/volatile.png"

					<p>
						Embarking on the intriguing challenge of understanding volatile migration on celestial bodies
						like Mercury and the Moon, I initiated a project to simulate and analyze the intricate pathways
						of water and carbon dioxide across the surface of Mercury. The focus was on executing an
						efficient computational model capable of simulating the migration of thousands to millions of
						water molecules. The ultimate goal was to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying this
						volatile migration process, particularly as it pertains to the journey of water molecules
						towards the North and South poles of Mercury.</p>
					<p>Troubleshooting the model proved to be a vital aspect of the project, as the complex interplay of
						factors governing volatile migration required careful consideration. I encountered challenges in
						fine-tuning the model parameters to accurately reflect the known behaviors of water and carbon
						dioxide on the surfaces of these celestial bodies. Iterative adjustments were made to the
						simulation algorithms, ensuring that the model not only produced realistic results but also
						aligned with empirical observations. Addressing issues related to convergence and stability
						became paramount, and the troubleshooting process involved a meticulous examination of the
						model's behavior under different conditions.
					</p>
					<p>A key aspect of the project involved a dedicated effort to reduce time complexity in the
						computational simulations. As the scale of the simulation expanded to encompass thousands to
						millions of molecules, computational bottlenecks became apparent. To enhance the efficiency of
						the model, I explored optimizations such as parallelization and algorithmic improvements. By
						strategically reevaluating data processing workflows and leveraging parallel computing
						capabilities, I succeeded in significantly reducing the time complexity of the simulations. This
						not only facilitated the exploration of larger-scale scenarios but also positioned the model for
						practical applications in further studies of volatile migration on Mercury.</p>
