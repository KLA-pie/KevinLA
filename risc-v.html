						<h1>VHDL of a RISC-V CPU</h1>
					</header>
					<span class="image left onload-image-fade-in"><img src="Website-Photos/risc-v.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Engineering a high-performance RISC-V CPU has been a gratifying and intellectually stimulating
						experience. From the conceptualization phase to the intricate details of implementation, I
						delved into the realm of VHDL to bring this CPU to life. The heart of the processor was
						meticulously crafted, with a particular focus on essential components such as the ALU,
						debouncer, and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Each component played a crucial role in shaping the
						CPU's overall functionality, contributing to its efficiency and performance.</p>
					<p>In the process, I found myself deeply involved in the drafting and design of various elements,
						including muxes, decoders, pulse generators, adders, and comparators. These components not only
						form the backbone of the CPU but also showcase the meticulous attention to detail required in
						the field of digital design. One of the significant challenges I encountered was mitigating gate
						transistor delay, a critical aspect that demanded a strategic approach to ensure optimal
						performance. Through overcoming these challenges, I honed not only my VHDL proficiency but also
						enriched my understanding of computer architecture, gaining insights that extend beyond the
						theoretical realm.
					</p>
					<p>As the project unfolded, the synergy between theory and hands-on implementation became
						increasingly apparent. The intricacies of the CPU's design demanded a holistic understanding of
						computer architecture, and with each component drafted and implemented, I found myself refining
						my skills and deepening my appreciation for the intricate dance between hardware and software
						that defines modern computing systems. The project stands as a testament to my dedication to
						pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and skills, as well as a tangible representation of the
						fusion between creativity and technical expertise in the world of digital design.</p>
